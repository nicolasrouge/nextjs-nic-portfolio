      Currently working at <a href="#"><u>Cox Automotive🚗⚡</u></a>, where I'm tackling the challenge of revamping a vehicle delivery platform.
      <br />
      <br /> 
      Before joining Cox, I was at MatrixIQ, UK, contributing to a vehicle fleet management platform and developing an app from scratch <a href="#"><u>Driive Academy👩🏻‍🎓</u></a>, now used by thousands of users 🌟. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Prior to that, I honed my skills across various sectors, including healthcare, banking services.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm always excited to explore new tools and technologies, from Cloud and AI to DevOps! 🛠️
      <br />
      <br />

      In my spare time, I love working on mini projects to sharpen my skills and stay engaged with the tech community: 
      <br />
      🔹<a href="#"><u>Cox Automotive Hackathon (AI)</u></a>
