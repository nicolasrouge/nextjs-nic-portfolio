## Dictionaries in C#

Dictionaries in C# are a type of collection that allow you to store key-value pairs. 
Each value is associated with a unique key, which can be used to quickly retrieve the corresponding value later on.

Under the hood, dictionaries in C# are typically implemented as hash tables, 
which use a hash function to compute an index into an array where the value is stored. 
This allows for very fast retrieval of values based on their keys, even for very large collections.

Dictionary is defined under System.Collections.Generic namespace. It is dynamic in nature means the size of the dictionary is grows according to the need. Important Points:

The Dictionary class implements the
- IDictionary TKey,TValue Interface
- IReadOnlyCollection KeyValuePair TKey,TValue Interface
- IReadOnlyDictionary TKey,TValue Interface
- IDictionary Interface
- In Dictionary, the key cannot be null, but value can be.
- In Dictionary, key must be unique. Duplicate keys are not allowed if you try to use duplicate key then compiler will throw an exception.
- In Dictionary, you can only store same types of elements.
- The capacity of a Dictionary is the number of elements that Dictionary can hold.

Here's an example of how you could use a dictionary in C#. Let's say you want to store some information about a group of people, such as their names and ages. You could create a dictionary with strings as the keys (for the names) and integers as the values (for the ages), like this:
  
```csharp
Dictionary<string, int> ages = new Dictionary<string, int>();
ages.Add("Alice", 28);
ages.Add("Bob", 35);
ages.Add("Charlie", 42);
```
Now you can easily retrieve someone's age based on their name, like this:
    
```csharp
int aliceAge = ages["Alice"]; // aliceAge will be 28
```

You can also iterate over all the key-value pairs in the dictionary using a foreach loop, like this:

```csharp
foreach (KeyValuePair<string, int> pair in ages)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{pair.Key} is {pair.Value} years old");
}
```
This will output the following:
    
```rust
Alice's age is 28
Bob's age is 35
Charlie's age is 42
```
