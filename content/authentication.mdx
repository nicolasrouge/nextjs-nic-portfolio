<p>OAuth is an open standard for authorization that allows third-party applications to access a user's resources (such as profile information or data) on a web service (such as Facebook or Google) without the user sharing their credentials with the third-party application. Instead, OAuth allows the user to grant access to their resources to the third-party application through a secure authorization process.</p>
